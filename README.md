### File Search in Azure OpenAI Assistants: Expanding Knowledge with External Information

This repository provides a comprehensive example of how to create an assistant using Azure OpenAI, leveraging the file search feature to enhance the assistant's knowledge with external information. The solution integrates file upload and OpenAI's vector store to enable the assistant to access and utilize additional data in its responses.

The implementation demonstrates the entire process, from the initial creation of the assistant in Azure, configuring the file search, to the final interaction where the assistant uses external information to respond to queries. This repository serves as a practical reference for developers looking to incorporate file search capabilities into their Azure OpenAI assistants, making them more intelligent and context-aware.
